There are five python files that have the codes.

LSI_mindf2.py file contains the code that was used to implement all the parts till part i using LSI dimensionality reduction with a min_df value of 2. The code can be run normally and the values in the variables can be viewed in variable explorer or by printing it. 

LSI_mindf5.py file contains the code that was used to implement all the parts till part i using LSI dimensionality reduction with a min_df value of 5. The code can be run normally and the values in the variables can be viewed in variable explorer or by printing it. 

NMF.py file contains the code that was used to implement all the parts till part i using NMF dimensionality reduction with a min_df value of 2. The code can be run normally and the values in the variables can be viewed in variable explorer or by printing it. 

Multi-class.py contains the code that was used to implement the multiclass classification. It contains both LSI and NMF. It is recommended to run the first half of the code first to view the results of LSI and second half of the code next to view the results of NMF separately. This is due to the code repetition for the two dimensionality reduction techniques.

TF-ICF.py contains the code that was used for the part c of the question. The code can be run normally and the values in the variables can be viewed in variable explorer or by printing it.
