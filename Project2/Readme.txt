There are four python files that have the codes.

LSI_2.py file contains the code that was used to implement all the parts till question 4 using LSI dimensionality reduction for 2 clusters. The code can be run normally and the values in the variables can be viewed in variable explorer or by looking at the printed results. 

NMF_2.py file contains the code that was used to implement all the parts till question 4 using NMF dimensionality reduction for 2 clusters. The code can be run normally and the values in the variables can be viewed in variable explorer or by looking at the printed results. 

LSI_20.py file contains the code that was used to implement the question 5 using LSI dimensionality reduction for 20 clusters. The code can be run normally and the values in the variables can be viewed in variable explorer or by looking at the printed results. 

NMF_20.py file contains the code that was used to implement the question 5 using NMF dimensionality reduction for 20 clusters. The code can be run normally and the values in the variables can be viewed in variable explorer or by looking at the printed results.
